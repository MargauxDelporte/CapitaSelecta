    "My exam paper consists of an analysis of the movie review section of the New York times. This site contains an API that gives access to over 22,000 New York Times movie reviews from today back to 1924. In the first part I create a function to make the search in the API automated. Since the text of the reviews is not included in the API, the second part is scraping the movie reviews pages. A sentiment analysis of a review is included in the third part. The fourth path integrates the previous three parts in one function; when you search for a movie in the API, you get the movie, the text and the sentiment analysis. In the last part I use text mining to predict whether the movie is recommended by the New York times critics or not.\n"

      "“Long Shot” isn’t going to save the romantic comedy, but it’s an adrenaline shot of pure pleasure to the genre’s failing heart. The outline is familiar: Two people meet, retreat and then circle each other, all while talking and talking. The romantic comedy turns on people who fit together — in bed, on the dance floor — but also talk to each other, exchanging words that stop flowing and faltering only with a culminating kiss and teasing fade-out. The difference here is that unlike a lot of romances, the woman retains her power and identity, and that’s how the movie likes it.\n",
      "In “Long Shot,” Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron), the secretary of state of the United States, and Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen), a struggling journalist, talk a lot. They connect while attending a charity event — Boyz II Men is crooning onstage — spotting each other across a crowded room. It’s a classic meet cute, in the parlance of the romantic comedy, but with a twist. Charlotte used to babysit Fred (she’s a few years older), a fact that still looms large in his memory. They haven’t seen each other since, but when they meet again they quickly spark, lighting a long fuse that winds through the story as nostalgia turns into something sweeter and then heavier.\n",
      "It’s preposterous: She’s a giant, a goddess and he’s … Seth Rogen. It doesn’t bode well that the movie initially seems more interested in Fred than in Charlotte, an apparent imbalance that suggests this will be another weak chuckle-fest in which the female lead is a convenience or decoration, on hand mainly to vouch for her guy’s heterosexuality. The opener, though — with Fred undercover in a roomful of neo-Nazis — proves tactical. It sets a strangely uneasy mood for a comedy, one that’s funny ha-ha but also unsettling. More to the story’s point, it also places Fred in the most toxic of man caves imaginable: a homosocial world of booze-chugging, chest-thumping, sieg-heiling bros.\n",
      "Image\n",
      "The journalist and Madam Secretary.CreditMurray Close/Lionsgate\n",
      "Of course Fred escapes — taunting the enemy, he briefly turns into a self-proclaimed Jewish superhero — and his adventure is folded into a subplot. It’s a shrewd introduction, one that establishes Fred’s ethical principles and willingness to take risks; it also gives him an early, crucial triumph. Just as important, it offers a semi-comic glimpse at a culture that fetishizes manliness and devalues women. When Fred flees, he breaks away from baddies but also from the ultimate in masculinity cults. It’s in keeping with a character who may have a best dude on speed dial (the amusing O’Shea Jackson Jr.) yet doesn’t suffer from the usual movie male maladies, including fear of women.\n",
      "Charlotte soon enters, effortlessly dominating every scene and room while juggling and suffering assorted fools, including the president of the United States (Bob Odenkirk in peerless form). Theron, a natural screen presence who has developed into an undeniable one, is wonderful in “Long Shot.” She’s a fascinating performer with a watchfulness that can make her seem detached. She seems supremely and confidently alone onscreen, which in moments can create an internal tension with her physical superfluidity, her outward, inviting flow. It’s an ideal combination for this character who never breaks stride as she agilely evades obstacles, most of which are men (Andy Serkis, Alexander Skarsgard).\n",
      "“Long Shot” humorously skitters over these and other hurdles, including the imperative that powerful single women must have men by their side, mostly to make everyone feel comfortable with all that female power. That’s a tricky idea for any romantic comedy to take on, one that “Long Shot” doesn’t solve but instead slides over after Charlotte hires Fred as a speechwriter. Much of what happens isn’t surprising, but Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah’s script is consistently, genially funny, filled with patter and nonsense, and spiked with sincerity and a few gross-out flourishes. And while the director, Jonathan Levine, doesn’t do much visually, he pulls off the occasional, well-timed sight gags and often puts Charlotte and Fred in the same shot — they even share the frame — rather than loading up on the usual TV-friendly close-ups of single heads.\n",
      "Movies have long segregated men and women by genre, but at some point we seemed to enter a new age of his-or-her cinema. Straight men and women went their separate, generally unequal ways and stopped talking, really talking, to each other in movies. Men retreated into buddy pictures à la Butch and Sundance or swooned into bromances; for their part, women prepped for weddings that felt like battles or indulged in a hangover-inducing hurrah. The romantic comedies in which men and women hook up have often been excruciating (“The Ugly Truth,” “The Proposal”), fueled by sexist stereotypes and gender policing that suggested women’s lib had given Hollywood a permanent headache.\n",
      "Yet we just can’t quit romantic comedy, even if contemporary American movies as a whole are more comfortable making war than peace, much less love. The reasons are cultural, social and industrial, at once obvious and obscure. One problem is the current business model in which big studios pour tremendous resources into globally salable male-driven blockbusters. The other problem is the industry’s deep-seated, long-maintained fear of female power. In a business long defined by aesthetic and economic conservatism, and that has a bad habit of selling the same stories, women — including those who are sexually desirable, desiring and sovereign — remain a puzzle and a threat.\n",
      "It’s no wonder that after decades of putting women in rigidly circumscribed roles the industry has had a tough time figuring out what to do with them. If things have started to shift it’s partly because heroines like Katniss Everdeen and creators like Amy Schumer are helping redefine the female lead. Like Mindy Kaling and other funny women, Schumer is doing it with laughs and stumbles, but also with an earnestness that affirms something real is at stake: love, hearts and maybe, possibly, a gender-fluid happily ever after. “Long Shot” mostly just toys with some of these ideas; it’s awfully straight, in all senses. But it doesn’t just put a woman on top, it also leaves her there, blissfully.\n"

Straight men and women went their separate, generally unequal ways and stopped talking, really talking, to each other in movies. Men retreated into buddy pictures à la Butch and Sundance or swooned into bromances; for their part, women prepped for weddings that felt like battles or indulged in a hangover-inducing hurrah. The romantic comedies in which men and women hook up have often been excruciating (“The Ugly Truth,” “The Proposal”), fueled by sexist stereotypes and gender policing that suggested women’s lib had given Hollywood a permanent headache.\n",
      "Yet we just can’t quit romantic comedy, even if contemporary American movies as a whole are more comfortable making war than peace, much less love. The reasons are cultural, social and industrial, at once obvious and obscure. One problem is the current business model in which big studios pour tremendous resources into globally salable male-driven blockbusters. The other problem is the industry’s deep-seated, long-maintained fear of female power. In a business long defined by aesthetic and economic conservatism, and that has a bad habit of selling the same stories, women — including those who are sexually desirable, desiring and sovereign — remain a puzzle and a threat.\n",
      "It’s no wonder that after decades of putting women in rigidly circumscribed roles the industry has had a tough time figuring out what to do with them. If things have started to shift it’s partly because heroines like Katniss Everdeen and creators like Amy Schumer are helping redefine the female lead. Like Mindy Kaling and other funny women, Schumer is doing it with laughs and stumbles, but also with an earnestness that affirms something real is at stake: love, hearts and maybe, possibly, a gender-fluid happily ever after. “Long Shot” mostly just toys with some of these ideas; it’s awfully straight, in all senses. But it doesn’t just put a woman on top, it also leaves her there, blissfully.\n"

       "'“Long Shot” isn’t going to save the romantic comedy, but it’s an adrenaline shot of pure pleasure to the genre’s failing heart. The outline is familiar: Two people meet, retreat and then circle each other, all while talking and talking. The romantic comedy turns on people who fit together — in bed, on the dance floor — but also talk to each other, exchanging words that stop flowing and faltering only with a culminating kiss and teasing fade-out. The difference here is that unlike a lot of romances, the woman retains her power and identity, and that’s how the movie likes it.\\nIn “Long Shot,” Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron), the secretary of state of the United States, and Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen), a struggling journalist, talk a lot. They connect while attending a charity event — Boyz II Men is crooning onstage — spotting each other across a crowded room. It’s a classic meet cute, in the parlance of the romantic comedy, but with a twist. Charlotte used to babysit Fred (she’s a few years older), a fact that still looms large in his memory. They haven’t seen each other since, but when they meet again they quickly spark, lighting a long fuse that winds through the story as nostalgia turns into something sweeter and then heavier.\\nIt’s preposterous: She’s a giant, a goddess and he’s … Seth Rogen. It doesn’t bode well that the movie initially seems more interested in Fred than in Charlotte, an apparent imbalance that suggests this will be another weak chuckle-fest in which the female lead is a convenience or decoration, on hand mainly to vouch for her guy’s heterosexuality. The opener, though — with Fred undercover in a roomful of neo-Nazis — proves tactical. It sets a strangely uneasy mood for a comedy, one that’s funny ha-ha but also unsettling. More to the story’s point, it also places Fred in the most toxic of man caves imaginable: a homosocial world of booze-chugging, chest-thumping, sieg-heiling bros.\\nImage\\nThe journalist and Madam Secretary.CreditMurray Close/Lionsgate\\nOf course Fred escapes — taunting the enemy, he briefly turns into a self-proclaimed Jewish superhero — and his adventure is folded into a subplot. It’s a shrewd introduction, one that establishes Fred’s ethical principles and willingness to take risks; it also gives him an early, crucial triumph. Just as important, it offers a semi-comic glimpse at a culture that fetishizes manliness and devalues women. When Fred flees, he breaks away from baddies but also from the ultimate in masculinity cults. It’s in keeping with a character who may have a best dude on speed dial (the amusing O’Shea Jackson Jr.) yet doesn’t suffer from the usual movie male maladies, including fear of women.\\nCharlotte soon enters, effortlessly dominating every scene and room while juggling and suffering assorted fools, including the president of the United States (Bob Odenkirk in peerless form). Theron, a natural screen presence who has developed into an undeniable one, is wonderful in “Long Shot.” She’s a fascinating performer with a watchfulness that can make her seem detached. She seems supremely and confidently alone onscreen, which in moments can create an internal tension with her physical superfluidity, her outward, inviting flow. It’s an ideal combination for this character who never breaks stride as she agilely evades obstacles, most of which are men (Andy Serkis, Alexander Skarsgard).\\n“Long Shot” humorously skitters over these and other hurdles, including the imperative that powerful single women must have men by their side, mostly to make everyone feel comfortable with all that female power. That’s a tricky idea for any romantic comedy to take on, one that “Long Shot” doesn’t solve but instead slides over after Charlotte hires Fred as a speechwriter. Much of what happens isn’t surprising, but Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah’s script is consistently, genially funny, filled with patter and nonsense, and spiked with sincerity and a few gross-out flourishes. And while the director, Jonathan Levine, doesn’t do much visually, he pulls off the occasional, well-timed sight gags and often puts Charlotte and Fred in the same shot — they even share the frame — rather than loading up on the usual TV-friendly close-ups of single heads.\\nMovies have long segregated men and women by genre, but at some point we seemed to enter a new age of his-or-her cinema. Straight men and women went their separate, generally unequal ways and stopped talking, really talking, to each other in movies. Men retreated into buddy pictures à la Butch and Sundance or swooned into bromances; for their part, women prepped for weddings that felt like battles or indulged in a hangover-inducing hurrah. The romantic comedies in which men and women hook up have often been excruciating (“The Ugly Truth,” “The Proposal”), fueled by sexist stereotypes and gender policing that suggested women’s lib had given Hollywood a permanent headache.\\nYet we just can’t quit romantic comedy, even if contemporary American movies as a whole are more comfortable making war than peace, much less love. The reasons are cultural, social and industrial, at once obvious and obscure. One problem is the current business model in which big studios pour tremendous resources into globally salable male-driven blockbusters. The other problem is the industry’s deep-seated, long-maintained fear of female power. In a business long defined by aesthetic and economic conservatism, and that has a bad habit of selling the same stories, women — including those who are sexually desirable, desiring and sovereign — remain a puzzle and a threat.\\nIt’s no wonder that after decades of putting women in rigidly circumscribed roles the industry has had a tough time figuring out what to do with them. If things have started to shift it’s partly because heroines like Katniss Everdeen and creators like Amy Schumer are helping redefine the female lead. Like Mindy Kaling and other funny women, Schumer is doing it with laughs and stumbles, but also with an earnestness that affirms something real is at stake: love, hearts and maybe, possibly, a gender-fluid happily ever after. “Long Shot” mostly just toys with some of these ideas; it’s awfully straight, in all senses. But it doesn’t just put a woman on top, it also leaves her there, blissfully.'"

      "“Ugliness is a crime against humanity.”\n",
      "Because that smug, straight-faced remark by Luc (Éric Bruneau), a handsome, successful architect to a group of supercilious friends in “An Eye for Beauty” is not entirely facetious, you may never forgive him for it. Nor should you.\n",
      "Written and directed by the Canadian filmmaker Denys Arcand (“The Barbarian Invasions,” which won a 2004 Academy Award for best foreign picture), “An Eye for Beauty” is the cinematic equivalent of a photo spread in Vogue or Architectural Digest that taunts you with images of rich, well-to-do beautiful people leading the tastefully glamorous life.\n",
      "If the movie were a satire, which it should be, the vanity and snobbery of Luc and his circle of friends, many of them in their 30s, wouldn’t be so suffocating. These people who appraise everything in sight with the icy scrutiny of art-world sharks, might as well be humanoids for all the warmth they exude. They also love to complain. How unfortunate it is, one laments, that ancient sites like Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat are being overrun with tourists. The name Ikea is spoken with such contempt that it sounds like a curse. At least we don’t hear the “p” word (that would be “peasants”) applied to those less fortunate, which is almost everybody with less refined taste.\n",
      "The first sign of a crack in the facade of this cold, perfect world is the discomfort of Luc’s beautiful wife, Stéphanie (Mélanie Thierry), while watching a television documentary showing the fall of Muammar el-Qaddafi. It disturbs the serenity of the couple’s modern aerie outside Quebec City and prompts her to wonder nervously, “Are we real?”\n",
      "Good question.\n",
      "The film’s temperature rises to slightly above freezing in its second half when Stéphanie’s angst leads to full-scale panic attacks that result in her hospitalization. Luc, while visiting Toronto to accept an award, succumbs to the charms of Lindsay (Melanie Merkosky), a predatory, about-to-be-divorced beauty who bluntly propositions him within minutes of their meeting. Showing up in Quebec weeks later, she tells him she loves him, although there are no signs of an emotional bond beyond games of footsie leading to cool, picture-perfect sex in which not a hair is ruffled or genuine passion exhibited.\n",
      "The message that “An Eye for Beauty” wants to send is that gorgeous people suffer just like the rest of us. But it is so enamored of them that the message gets lost en route to the screen. What really matters is the lighting.\n",
      "A low point in the director’s career, this sleek chilly film isn’t acted so much as posed.\n",
      "“An Eye for Beauty” is not rated, is in English and French with English subtitles, and runs 1 hour 42 minutes.\n"

      "Heroic messenger or adrenaline addict? Truth teller or vulture? In “1,000 Times Good Night,” Rebecca (Juliette Binoche), a celebrated, morally self-righteous war photographer hooked on risk-taking, leads two lives that are in continual conflict.\n",
      "Between grueling assignments in which she faces death by venturing into the heart of the fray, camera in hand, Rebecca returns to a picture-perfect existence at her home on the Irish seacoast. She is married to Marcus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, from “Game of Thrones”), a dashing marine biologist who frets every time she departs for a war front. They have two daughters; the elder, Stephanie (Lauryn Canny), is a teenager and a precociously talented artist.\n",
      "These glossily photographed domestic interludes resemble a high-end magazine spread in which the camera slavers over images of virtuous, beautiful people savoring the good life. You have the impression that, to a degree, Rebecca’s hazardous work is a form of atonement for good fortune that she feels she doesn’t deserve.\n",
      "The character is a stand-in for the film’s Norwegian director, Erik Poppe, a former photojournalist who, in a statement, recalls his thinking in that earlier career: “I wanted to tell my readers all over the world, ‘This is what you should be concerned about.’ ” My skeptical retort to that in today’s hyperactive media culture, in which more pictures of horror are spread than can possibly be assimilated, amounts to four words: “Good luck with that.”\n",
      "As the movie begins, Rebecca, while working undercover on a story about life inside the Taliban, is snapping pictures of explosives being strapped onto a female suicide bomber by other women. The screenplay, by Harald Rosenlow Eeg, implicitly compares Rebecca’s willingness to die for her work with the women’s embrace of sacrifice for a religious cause.\n",
      "Rebecca is so avid to be at the center of the action that she rides in the car carrying the bomber into the heart of the Afghan capital. After hurriedly exiting on the street, she can’t resist taking one more shot. When the police notice, the bomb is prematurely detonated and Rebecca, who later blames herself, is seriously injured. The scene brings up the subject of how a photojournalist’s presence can shape events. Her guilty conscience is no palliative for lives lost.\n",
      "Rebecca, who suffers a punctured lung, returns home. When Marcus insists she stop covering wars, she halfheartedly agrees. The movie brings in, then wisely drops, a half-baked subplot about possible government censorship of photojournalists.\n",
      "What makes “1,000 Times Good Night” more than a dramatic essay on wartime journalism is Ms. Binoche’s wrenchingly honest portrayal of a woman of conscience driven by a mixture of guilt, nobility and self-importance, reckoning belatedly with her destructive impulses. Her final challenge is a trip with Steph to the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya to help her daughter gather material for a school project on Africa. On a journey that she is assured involves no risk, a surprise attack on the camp puts them in harm’s way, and Rebecca disobeys orders and compulsively rushes into the melee.\n",
      "Rebecca has already explained to her daughter that she is gripped by an unassuageable anger. Even when Ms. Binoche smiles, it registers as a shadow of sorrow on the face of someone who has seen too much of the world’s horrors to forget them. She is one of a few screen actors who can convey multiple conflicting emotions in a single glance. With an astonishing transparency, she disappears into the truth of her characters.\n",
      "That truth can be ugly. When Rebecca is shown crouching over a fresh corpse and aiming her camera, she suggests nothing so much as a ravenous bird of prey.\n"

    "The last part of my project is to predict whether the movie is a critics pick or not. The critics pick is a binary variable that indicates whether the critic recommends the movie or not. First I construct my training and test set. Next, I conduct a small exploratory analysis. Since there is a class imbalance, I upsample the critics picks. Further, the features entail an array of dummy variables of words. This is created with CountVectorizer. TF-IDF is also applied to give smart weights to the words. Futher I fit logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors and multinomial naive bayes. The parameters of the algorithms are optimalized with GridSearch. Each model is evaluated on the test set and compared to the previous models."

       "      <td>Phillip Noyce's ''Dead Calm'' is an unsettling hybrid of escapist suspense and the kind of pure trash that depends on dead babies and murdered dogs for effect. In it, John and Rae Ingram (Sam Neill and Nicole Kidman) are a husband and wife alone on their yacht in still waters. They are joined by a classic intruder, the mysterious stranger, who in this case doesn't arrive nearly soon enough.First, we hear about a car accident in which Rae was injured and their small son killed. This is the excuse Mr. Noyce needs to send his characters on their restful cruise, but he doesn't leave things there. He re-creates one of Rae's nightmares, and we watch a beautiful little boy clutching a teddy bear smash through the windshield of the car. ''Dead Calm'' moves above this shoddy beginning and sinks back to its sleazy level a dizzying number of times.Based on the Charles Williams novel, which did not have dead babies or dogs, the story has no surprises, but there are plenty of opportunities for ...</td>\n",

       "'“Shot Caller” is the third feature from Ric Roman Waugh (“Snitch,” “Felon”) to illustrate the notion that prisons make criminals instead of reforming them. Once a man is institutionalized, a character in “Shot Caller” says, “anything is possible.”\\nTo prove that thesis, “Shot Caller” stretches “anything” well beyond credulity. Involving yet trivializing, the movie unfolds as a would-be “Breaking Bad” of the prison genre, following an inadvertent criminal who is hardened by a gangland behind bars and eventually becomes one of its cleverest members.\\nBefore incarceration, Jacob Harlon (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, from “Game of Thrones”) is a stockbroker from Pasadena. When he’s arrested after a fatal drunken-driving accident, concomitant charges and sentencing guidelines leave him in a bind that sends him to prison for far longer than he and his wife (Lake Bell) anticipated. Once there, he falls under the protection of a white-power gang; proves his cred by murdering a snitch; and meets the Beast (Holt McCallany), a prison leader who spouts aphorisms (“a warrior’s deadliest weapon is his mind”) and who supposedly runs California from his open-air cage.\\n“Shot Caller” interweaves before-and-after timelines, toggling between Jacob’s initiation and his life after release, a decade later, as a tattooed, muscular ex-con plotting an arms deal. Both the prison and the gangs have rules, Jacob says, but the gangs’ rules matter. “Shot Caller” effectively conveys the vise grip of Jacob’s options, but that doesn’t make it less ludicrous from scene to scene.'"

Notice that I use the training set in order to not bias the results, since some texts are copied. Further, the english stop words are excluded, since these words do not provide much analytical leverage. In addition, I only include the words that appear in more than 2% of the documents and in less than 80% of the documents. In this way I exclude corpus specific stop words. The lower bound excludes very rare words, which are dangerous for overfitting. I include unigrams and bigrams in the analysis. "

I will first finetune this parameter with crossvalidation. For the nearest neighbour model, I will not use the oversampled training set. The reason is that the model picks one as the optimal number of nearest neighbors. This is quite logical, since predicting the class of the nearest neighbor results in predicting the class of the clone in some cases. Hence, this will also bias the accuracy on the training data in a positive way. The reason is that the nearest neighbout is always the clone for the upsampled cases. As a consequence, I only use the training data."

    "My last model is a multinomial naive bayes model. This model calculates probabilities of class membership by applying the Bayes theorem. The model makes a strong assumption: the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. One can discuss whether the assumption holds in this data; it means that the presence or absence of a word is independent of the presence or absence of another word, given whether the movie is a critics pick or not. However, some literature suggest this algorithm works well when the assumption does not hold (e.g. Zhang H., The Optimality of Naive Bayes, AAAI 1, no. 2 (2004))"
